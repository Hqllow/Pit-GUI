# Solargators Telemetry GUI

On the race track we have data being read and recorded on the solar car. Previously this data was read locally and wasn't moved off the vehicle until after the competition. Now we would like to display the realtime telemetry information on a GUI at the the pit. The telemetry information consists of voltage, current, temperature, GPS data, etc.

Please refer to the  [Pit-GUI documentation on readthedocs](https://docs.ufsolargators.org/en/latest/Electrical/Telemetry/gui.html).
